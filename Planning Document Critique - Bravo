Team: Bravo
Document: Project Timeline Authentication
- created separate timelines for each sub team but did not include an overall timeline
that accounts for how each team work will integrate together
- had more than 5 use case descriptions that were not accounted for in the planning document

Document: Project Timeline Networking
- set goals to evaluate other teams' work and start drafting coding functionality all within
week 2 which might be unrealistic
- didn't mention anything about class structure diagrams in their planning

Document: Project Timeline Game Logic
- didn't mention anything about creating the planning documents
- didn't specify about use case descriptions
- could have specified which three games were chosen for the deliverables

Document: Project Timeline Integration
- demonstration videos mentioned in week 2?

Document: Project Timeline GUI
- set week 2 March 10-14 for designing the GUI but did not account for the the main purpose
of iteration 2 which was to review another team's project
- set all of iteration 1's deliverables (use case diagrams, use case descriptions, class diagrams,
planning docs) to be completed in 1 week instead of 2 which might also be unrealistic

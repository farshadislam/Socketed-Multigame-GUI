Use Case: Play Checkers

Actors:

Player 1

Player 2

System (if playing against AI)

Preconditions:

A checkerboard is set up with pieces in their initial positions.

Each player has a valid account (if playing online) or is physically present.

Triggers:

A player starts a new game.

Main Flow:

The system initializes the game board with pieces placed in starting positions.

Player 1 (usually assigned the darker pieces) makes the first move.

Player 2 (lighter pieces) makes a move in response.

Players alternate turns, moving pieces diagonally according to the rules of Checkers:

Regular pieces move diagonally forward.

If a jump is available, it must be taken.

A piece that reaches the opposite end of the board is promoted to a king.

The system enforces legal moves and highlights valid moves (if applicable).

The game continues until one player captures all opposing pieces or blocks all valid moves.

The system declares the winner and may offer options for a rematch.

Alternative Flows:

Invalid Move: If a player attempts an illegal move, the system notifies them and prevents the move.

Resignation: A player can resign, automatically giving the win to the opponent.

Draw: If neither player can make a valid move, the game ends in a draw.

Postconditions:

The game result is recorded (if applicable).

The players return to the main menu or start a new game.

Extensions:

If playing against an AI, the system generates moves for the AI player.

If playing online, the system manages network connectivity and turn synchronization.

If playing with a timer, the system enforces time constraints per move.

Assumptions:

Players understand the basic rules of Checkers.

The game interface is functioning properly.
